      $\phi_a^{\prime}$ and $\phi_b^{\prime}$.  Rigorous error bounds,

      \phi_b^{\prime}(2)]| \leq \delta$, are simply expressed in terms of
      information calculated separately for the pair of densities $\phi_a$ and
      $\phi_a^{\prime}$ and the pair $\phi_b$ and $\phi_b^{\prime}$. From the
      structure of the bound, a simple method of optimizing charge density
      approximations such that $\delta$ is minimized is derived.  The
      framework of the theory appears to be well suited for application to the
      approximation of electron repulsion integrals which occur in molecular
      structure theory, and applications to the approximation integrals over
      Slater orbitals or grouped Gaussian functions are discussed."

abstract={Organofluorine compounds are central to modern chemistry, and broadly applicable transformations that generate them efficiently and enan
tioselectively are in much demand. Here we introduce efficient catalytic methods for the addition of allyl and allenyl organoboron reagents to flu
orine-substituted ketones. These reactions are facilitated by readily and inexpensively available catalysts and deliver versatile and otherwise di
fficult-to-access tertiary homoallylic alcohols in up to 98% yield and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Utility is highlighted by a concise enantioselect
ive approach to the synthesis of the antiparasitic drug fluralaner (Bravecto, presently sold as the racemate). Different forms of ammoniumâ€“organof
luorine interactions play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity. The greater understanding of various non-bonding interactions afforded 
by these studies should facilitate the future development of transformations that involve fluoroorganic entities.},
