      We develop an algorithm for the CASSCF orbital optimization that uses
      sparsity in the atomic orbital (AO) basis set to increase the
      applicability of CASSCF. Our implementation of this algorithm uses
      graphical processing units (GPUs) and has allowed us to perform CASSCF
      computations on molecular systems containing more than one thousand
      atoms. Additionally, we have implemented analytic gradients of the
      CASSCF energy; the gradients also benefit from GPU acceleration as well
      as sparsity in the AO basis."

abstract={Organofluorine compounds are central to modern chemistry, and broadly applicable transformations that generate them efficiently and enan
tioselectively are in much demand. Here we introduce efficient catalytic methods for the addition of allyl and allenyl organoboron reagents to flu
orine-substituted ketones. These reactions are facilitated by readily and inexpensively available catalysts and deliver versatile and otherwise di
fficult-to-access tertiary homoallylic alcohols in up to 98% yield and >99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Utility is highlighted by a concise enantioselect
ive approach to the synthesis of the antiparasitic drug fluralaner (Bravecto, presently sold as the racemate). Different forms of ammonium–organof
luorine interactions play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity. The greater understanding of various non-bonding interactions afforded 
by these studies should facilitate the future development of transformations that involve fluoroorganic entities.},
