\section{A note on disk-bound blocking}

The size of tensors grow rapidly in quantum chemistry.  The 3-center integrals of density fitting are no exception.
Often, as the size of the AO three-index integrals will exceed 50GB of RAM for systems as small as 40 atoms when
a moderate basis set such as aug-cc-pVQZ is used, even with sparsity screening.  At that point, it is necessary for
any implementation to begin reading and writing these tensors to and from disk-based memory. For any field this can
be a major slowdown, but it is especially critical for performance when high dimensional data is involved. To illustrate
this issue, I will introduce an adapted tensor notation which better indicates memory layout.

We denote an $n$-dimensional tensor as $T_{ab\hdots n}$, where the indices from left to right go from the slowest-running
to the fastest-running indices. Here, $a$ is the slowest-running index, $b$ is the next slowest-running
index, and $n$ is the fastest-running index. The choice of memory layout plays a crucial role when indices are being accessed.
Iterating through the slowest-running index, $a$, would require the largest memory strides whereas the elements 
of the fastest-running index, $n$, are contiguous in memory. 

Now, we can consider two possible forms for the 3-index integrals: $A_{P\mu\nu}$ or $A_{\mu P\mu}$.
If these tensors are too large to fit into memory, we must read and write pieces of them to and from disk-based memory.
To accomplish this, we must choose an index to block accross. Primarily, this will involve either the $P$ or $\mu$ index.
For example, if we choose to block accross the $P$ index, then we will partition the basis of $P$ into discrete blocks:
\begin{align}
a;lkds
\end{align}

Then, we will read and write only those blocks of $P$ along with all of $\mu$ and $\nu$. The latency of these operations is
bound by the movement of a physical read-write head, so it is critically important to ensure that read and writes are as
contiguous as possible. In the case of $P$ blocking, the $A_{P\mu\nu}$ tensor is far superior to $A_{\mu P\mu}$ since the 
former will yield entirely contiguous operations whereas the latter will require strided operations.
